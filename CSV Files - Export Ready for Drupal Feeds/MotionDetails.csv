"216";"Passed    Motion To: Whereas in the Metrolinx update to the Transit Commission today, November 21, 2012, Commissioners were advised that there would be a delay in the projected February 1st, 2013 launch of the Presto Smart Card system in Ottawa; and 
Whereas Metrolinx, having identified core functional issues, has asked for an additional three months delay in the launch date; and 
Whereas the Transit Commission has been assured by Metrolinx that the core functional issues have been resolved and that the delay in the launch will allow Metolinx and OC Transpo to roll out the test the “loading” of the system with up to 10,000 customers using the product in January 2013; and 
Whereas OC Transpo and Metrolinx have agreed upon the following specific seven technical criteria “success factors” to measure the success of Presto, being: 
1. Customer convenience features, such as auto load, auto renew and web access, telephone; 
2. Pass Products available (including monthly passes for different categories and e-purse); 
3. STO interoperability (seamless); 
4. Robust back office (instant updates); 
5. Fare inspection functionality; 
6. Payment card industry (PCI) compliance; and 
7. Ongoing bilingual support to respond to customer needs (call centre to support the product demand); and 
Whereas the results of the technical system criteria along with the results of the system functionality on the seven success factors will be presented to the Transit Commission in April 2013, along with details regarding recommendations on the feasibility to move to full system roll out; and 
Whereas until this decision has been taken, no funds will flow to Metrolinx; and 
Whereas in recognition of the extended timeline for deployment and the role OC Transpo is playing in being the first user of PRESTO Next Generation, Metrolinx will be reducing the municipal contribution towards the remaining capital costs by $3 Million (effectively $1M a month for the delay); and 
Whereas in the event system acceptance is not achieved by June 1, 2013, either party reserves the option to consider other directions for the program at that time, including the option to discontinue the deployment of the PRESTO program in Ottawa. Metrolinx would make the City of Ottawa whole on its capital investment in the fare system, unless system acceptance is not achieved for reasons beyond Metrolinx’s control; and 
Therefore Be It Resolved That the Transit Commission approve the plan outlined in the update provided by Metrolinx the timelines set out below: 
1. Early January 2013: OC Transpo communications begin around the expansion of the program up to 10,000 additional users. 
2. Mid-January 2013: Initiate distribution of up to 10,000 cards and put into full production through the end of January. 
3. Mid-January to April 2013: Continue to monitor, conduct analysis and confirm positive results to inform broader public distribution. 
4. April 2013: Results will be presented to the Transit Commission to receive approval for continued deployment.

";"http://app05.ottawa.ca/sirepub/agdocs.aspx?doctype=agenda&itemid=118267";"Passed";NULL;"2273";"118267";"Passed    Motion To: Whereas in the Metrolinx update to the Transit Commission today, November 21, 2012, Commissioners were advised that there would be a delay in the projected February 1st, 2013 launch of the Presto Smart Card system in Ottawa; and 
Whereas Metrolinx, having identified core functional issues, has asked for an additional three months delay in the launch date; and 
Whereas the Transit Commission has been assured by Metrolinx that the core functional issues have been resolved and that the delay in the launch will allow Metolinx and OC Transpo to roll out the test the “loading” of the system with up to 10,000 customers using the product in January 2013; and 
Whereas OC Transpo and Metrolinx have agreed upon the following specific seven technical criteria “success factors” to measure the success of Presto, being: 
1. Customer convenience features, such as auto load, auto renew and web access, telephone; 
2. Pass Products available (including monthly passes for different categories and e-purse); 
3. STO interoperability (seamless); 
4. Robust back office (instant updates); 
5. Fare inspection functionality; 
6. Payment card industry (PCI) compliance; and 
7. Ongoing bilingual support to respond to customer needs (call centre to support the product demand); and 
Whereas the results of the technical system criteria along with the results of the system functionality on the seven success factors will be presented to the Transit Commission in April 2013, along with details regarding recommendations on the feasibility to move to full system roll out; and 
Whereas until this decision has been taken, no funds will flow to Metrolinx; and 
Whereas in recognition of the extended timeline for deployment and the role OC Transpo is playing in being the first user of PRESTO Next Generation, Metrolinx will be reducing the municipal contribution towards the remaining capital costs by $3 Million (effectively $1M a month for the delay); and 
Whereas in the event system acceptance is not achieved by June 1, 2013, either party reserves the option to consider other directions for the program at that time, including the option to discontinue the deployment of the PRESTO program in Ottawa. Metrolinx would make the City of Ottawa whole on its capital investment in the fare system, unless system acceptance is not achieved for reasons beyond Metrolinx’s control; and 
Therefore Be It Resolved That the Transit Commission approve the plan outlined in the update provided by Metrolinx the timelines set out below: 
1. Early January 2013: OC Transpo communications begin around the expansion of the program up to 10,000 additional users. 
2. Mid-January 2013: Initiate distribution of up to 10,000 cards and put into full production through the end of January. 
3. Mid-January to April 2013: Continue to monitor, conduct analysis and confirm positive results to inform broader public distribution. 
4. April 2013: Results will be presented to the Transit Commission to receive approval for continued deployment. At this time OC Transpo program implementation would be presented to outline the phased deployment plan to achieve full system rollout. Passed118267"
